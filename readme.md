# dynamicColorPage 2.0
Some months ago dynamicColorPage was a tiny jQuery plugin to easily adopt the page's styling.

But now it is a pure javascript "plugin" with some awesome new features!

## Moved to GitLab!!

I've always been a friend of Open-Source-code.
GitLab is a free open-source alternative to GitHub, so I've decided to move the repo to GitLab.

Please just follow the link and everything stays the same for you.

If you want, you can follow me to GitLab, too and make this new open-source community big!
